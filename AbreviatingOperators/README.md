# AbreviatingOperators

This folder contains code examples and explanations for the "AbreviatingOperators" lesson. Abbreviating operators in Java provide a shorthand way to perform common arithmetic and assignment operations.

## Explanation

Abbreviating operators combine arithmetic or assignment operations with the variable being operated upon. They allow for concise and efficient code. Here are some commonly used abbreviating operators:

- `+=`: Adds the right-hand side value to the variable and assigns the result to the variable.
- `-=`: Subtracts the right-hand side value from the variable and assigns the result to the variable.
- `*=`: Multiplies the variable by the right-hand side value and assigns the result to the variable.
- `/=`: Divides the variable by the right-hand side value and assigns the result to the variable.
- `%=`: Calculates the remainder of the variable divided by the right-hand side value and assigns the result to the variable.

## Usage

To use abbreviating operators in Java, follow these steps:

1. Declare and initialize a variable of a numeric data type.

2. Perform an operation using an abbreviating operator.

3. Print the result.

## Sample Code

```java
public class AbbreviatingOperatorsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 10;
        
        // Using the += operator
        number += 5;
        System.out.println("Number after addition: " + number);
        
        // Using the -= operator
        number -= 3;
        System.out.println("Number after subtraction: " + number);
        
        // Using the *= operator
        number *= 2;
        System.out.println("Number after multiplication: " + number);
        
        // Using the /= operator
        number /= 4;
        System.out.println("Number after division: " + number);
        
        // Using the %= operator
        number %= 3;
        System.out.println("Remainder after division: " + number);
    }
}```

##Output
Number after addition: 15
Number after subtraction: 12
Number after multiplication: 24
Number after division: 6
Remainder after division: 0

## Explanation

The program starts with the number variable initialized to 10. It then performs several arithmetic operations using abbreviated operators and prints the updated value of number after each operation.

    Line 33: number += 5; is equivalent to number = number + 5;. It adds 5 to the current value of number, resulting in 15.
    Line 37: number -= 3; is equivalent to number = number - 3;. It subtracts 3 from the current value of number, resulting in 12.
    Line 41: number *= 2; is equivalent to number = number * 2;. It multiplies the current value of number by 2, resulting in 24.
    Line 45: number /= 4; is equivalent to number = number / 4;. It divides the current value of number by 4, resulting in 6.
    Line 49: number %= 3; is equivalent to number = number % 3;. It calculates the remainder of the division of the current value of number by 3, resulting in 0.

The program then outputs the updated values of number after each operation.
